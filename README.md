# SmartFilter node.js bindings

## SmartFilter

The SmartFilter REST API is the easiest way for individuals and organizations to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks in their web applications. The API has been designed to provide simple access to the powerful content analysis systems and intelligence tools that Prevoty has developed.

## node.js bindings

Prevoty has developed a node.js compatible library to use SmartFilter quickly and easily. The node.js library uses `request`. A version of this is already bundled with this project.
